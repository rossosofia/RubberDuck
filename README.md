Mr. Duck - Problem Solving Assistant <br> Welcome to the Mr. Duck project! <br><br>
This repository contains a set of JavaScript exercises and web development tasks for a school project. The project features an interactive web application where users can solve problems with the Rubber Duck Method.

Thanks to this assignment I've dusted off:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Form validation
- Asynchronous operation
- Fetch and display API
- Local storage
